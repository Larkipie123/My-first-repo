        <h1>Why I love Gaming</h1>
            <p>
            Gaming allows me to destress (or stress me out) whenever i want to relax or when I am up for a challenge. It allows me to connect with my peers as well practice my communication, problem solving skills, and creativity when playing them.
            </p>
            <p>
            It also allows me to escape from reality once in a while and enjoy my personal space.
